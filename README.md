Dataset Description:
blinkit_data.csv

KPI’s Requirements:
Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold. 

Key Analysis Performed:
Total Sales by Fat Content.
Total Sales by Item Type.

Total Sales by Outlet Establishment.
Sales by Outlet Size.
Sales by Outlet Location.

Visualizations:
Donut Chart - Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
Bar Chart - Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
Stacked Column Chart - Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
Line Chart - Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
Donut/ Pie Chart - Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.

Outcome:
A complete end-to-end analysis that helps in understanding customer behavior, improving sales strategy, and enhancing overall business performance using data-driven decisions.
