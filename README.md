# Blinkit Data - Analysis using Python
This project involves analyzing customer, product, and transaction data from Blinkit (formerly Grofers), a popular online grocery delivery service. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about user behavior, product preferences, and sales performance using Python libraries.

Objectives:
Understand customer purchasing patterns.
Identify top-performing product categories and items.
Analyze revenue trends and transaction frequency.
Segment users based on behavior.
Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

Tools & Technologies:
Language: Python
Tool: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:
1.pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
2.numpy – Numerical computations
3.matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

Dataset Description:
blinkit_data.csv

KPI’s Requirements:
1.Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2.Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
3.Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
4.Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold. 

Key Analysis Performed:
1.Total Sales by Fat Content.
2.Total Sales by Item Type.
3.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales.
4.Total Sales by Outlet Establishment.
5.Sales by Outlet Size.
6.Sales by Outlet Location.

Visualizations:
1.Donut Chart - Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
2.Bar Chart - Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
3.Stacked Column Chart - Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
4.Line Chart - Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
5.Donut/ Pie Chart - Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.

Outcome:
A complete end-to-end analysis that helps in understanding customer behavior, improving sales strategy, and enhancing overall business performance using data-driven decisions.
